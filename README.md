# admin-page

A "admin page" project made alongside The Odin Project, during the first section of the Javascript course path.

This project is a demonstration of the ability to use flex grid layouts to create webpages. This project is made entirely using grid, without any use of flexbox.
The "target" style of the webpage, which this project's layout is based on, can be seen here:
